Versioning large files
Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) is an open-source extension to Git that allows you to work with large files the same way as any other text file.

With Git LFS, you and your repository's contributors can clone large files from the Git command line, open pull requests, and comment on the diffs. It's the ideal solution for pushing files to GitHub that are larger than 100 MB.

For more information on Git LFS, visit https://git-lfs.github.com.

About Git Large File Storage

Git LFS lets you store files up to 2 GB in size.

Installing Git Large File Storage

In order to use Git LFS, you'll need to download and install a new program that's separate from Git.

Configuring Git Large File Storage

Once Git LFS is installed, you need to associate it with a large file in your repository.

Collaboration with Git Large File Storage

With Git LFS enabled, you'll be able to fetch, modify, and push large files just as you would expect with any file that Git manages. However, a user that doesn't have Git LFS will experience a different workflow.
